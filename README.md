# Obesity Categorization Clustering around Various Traits
Obesity is a problem that many Americans are struggling with today. There is still some
disagreement however on why exactly this is the case and what traits/lifestyle choices
contribute to obesity the most. For example, two articles from highly reputable sources that were
considered in the motivation for this analysis take opposing stances on the relationship between
calorie intake and weight gain. One article takes the stance that unhealthy weight is heavily
influenced by the equation of calories in vs. calories burned, the other article takes the stance
that not all calories are equal and that calories alone do not tell the whole story. The dataset
gathered here contains information that may be related to obesity, and utilizes different unsupervised 
learning techniques such as:
- PCA, 
- k-means clustering, 
- hierarchical clustering 
to see if the predictors gathered do a good job of detecting and naturally grouping
people into their respective obesity categorization. Do certain traits tend to naturally group
people into obesity and non obesity, or do people randomly fall into their categorization
regardless of the traits collected in this dataset? Are there patterns that distinguish obesity
types, such as obesity type I and obesity type III or is there not a distinguishable difference in
these groups? That is what this analysis intends to look into further.
